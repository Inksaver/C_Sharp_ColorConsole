# C_Sharp_ColorConsole
Library to produce coloured C# Console applications with lines, boxes menus and controlled user input
This is the first of a number of related projects to improve the appearance of Console based projects.

It is aimed at students for projects where a full GUI is not used, and a coloured menu, input box, and other features are included.
A .pdf file will be added shortly to show all the features, and a Youtube video is planned.

The versions for Python and Lua have already been completed, and Java is being considered. Watch this space!
