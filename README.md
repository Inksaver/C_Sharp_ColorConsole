# C_Sharp_ColorConsole
Library to produce coloured C# Console applications with lines, boxes menus and controlled user input
This is the first of a number of related tutorials to improve the appearance of Console based projects.

It is aimed at students for projects where a full GUI is not used, and a coloured menu, input box, and other features are included.
A .pdf file has been added to highlight some features, and a Youtube video is planned.

The versions for Python, Lua and Java have now been completed
The files YTStage01.cs etc. are for demonstration in the Youtube presentation, and can be run with cs-script in VS Code or other editors
